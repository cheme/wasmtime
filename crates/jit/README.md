_This is a fork, patching some thread-safety into this crate. It is deprecated and
only exists until [#888](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/888) is fixed_

This is the `wasmtime-jit` crate, which contains JIT-based execution
for wasm, using the wasm ABI defined by [`wasmtime-environ`] and the
runtime support provided by [`wasmtime-runtime`].

[`wasmtime-runtime`]: https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime-runtime
